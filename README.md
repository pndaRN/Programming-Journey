Hello, dear reader! First, thank you for being curious enough to click here—I hope you find my journey insightful. <br><br>

My name is Mark Williams, and while I’m not a computer scientist, I *am* a nurse with a growing passion for computer science and this is my attempt at documenting my journey as an adult learner diving into CS. 

### Where I started
This isn’t my first attempt at learning CS. Back in 2014, I started college at the University of Oklahoma with a major in Computer Science. My first course introduced us to *drumroll…* Java! While Java is a solid and widely-used language (looking at you, Minecraft), it didn’t captivate me as an 18-year-old. We mostly wrote loops without seeing how they could build something meaningful. There was a lack of practical context, which made it hard to stay engaged. I ended up earning a B, lost interest, and switched majors.<br><br>
That changed in November 2024. <br><br>
While traveling to Poland with my wife and our five-month-old son (yes, I know, a bit wild), I found myself sitting in the Helsinki Airport (highly recommend—9/10). A random thought struck: “I used to enjoy programming. Why not pick it back up?” So I pulled out my phone and searched the app store. That’s when I discovered **Mimo**, a Duolingo-style app for learning programming. I started learning Python right there in the airport.<br><br>
From there, I entered the infamous “tutorial hell”—watching endless Python tutorials without truly learning how to program. Then I found **Harvard’s CS50**, which gave me a much better understanding of the fundamentals. Unfortunately, with my only free time during my son’s naps, progress was painfully slow. Eventually, I came across **boot.dev**, and something clicked. I started in February 2025 and have enjoyed every moment since. So, Lane—if you ever read this—thank you for creating such an amazing course!

## Where I am at now
This log will serve as my daily progress journal as I continue learning through boot.dev and other resources. Each day, I’ll write a short blurb about what I did and how I felt. At the end of every month, I’ll post a more detailed reflection.<br><br>

## May 2025

### May 21st, 2025
I used the seer stone on lesson 3.1 on the Static Site Generator(ssg) for boot.dev. The reason why is I could not remember the code and what they were trying to have me do since it had been a couple days since worked on that project.
Also started the regex section of chapter 3 of the ssg.

### May 22nd, 2025
I worked on memory management in C at work. Blew a 13/15 sharpshooter spree because I didn't read the question fully, feels bad man.

### May 24th, 2025
Knocked out a bunch of memory management lessons at work since it was a slow day and my patients that day didn't need much (that is a rare occurrence). Redeemed myself and got my sharpshooter spree back!

### May 25th, 2025
Finishing up a Sabbath and then had some friends over so I didn't get much programming done. So I just got a lesson in ssg done before bed but I am happy that I am still making progress!

### May 26th, 2025
Started using Memo to start learning some frontend development in a casual way. Hoping that by the time I am ready to work on a frontend (I really like Svelte so I will probably use that) I at least of some idea of what I am attempting to do.

### May 29th, 2025
I haven't been able to sit down at my home computer in a couple days so all I have been able to work on is memory management while I am at work. I just have to remember that learning/doing a little is better than doing nothing!

### May 30th, 2025
I was finally able to sit down at my computer to work on ssg and I was able to finish all the inline markdown. Happy to finally make some progress on that project.

### May 31st, 2025
Had a slow day at work so I was able to work on memory management. It actually is starting to make a lot of sense to me and I found myself enjoying writing in C!

## May 2025 Wrap-up
### Learning The Ways of The Penguin
May was a big month in my CS journey. I switched my main computer to Linux at the beginning of the month and the learning curve that came with that was really big! I was considering switching to Linux for a while but never actually pulled the trigger on it. The thing that finally helped me make the jump was PewDiePie's video that he switched to Linux and then The Primeagen's video reaction to that video. I was finally like "let's do it". <br><br>
So I chose Linux Mint as my distro because I wanted something to just work out of the box and that looked like Windows because my wife (who is not techie at all) was also going to use it for work. I am so glad I chose Mint because it was not like diving into the deep end but more like diving into an area where my toes could touch. I knew I was not going to drown but I had to work to keep my head above the water. Which I feel is the sweet spot for learning. So with all that came wanting to set up my programming environment. So the biggest hurdle with that is that there are so many dang options. Like holy moly there is so much. So sifting my way through all of it took some time. So here is what I have landed on. I am using Alacritty for my terminal because it has great documentation, a great community around it, and incredible customization. It is also stupid fast and I never have to wait. I have uploaded my Alacritty.toml file in my config_files on this repo. (*screen shot to come*) <br><br>
I have switched from bash to zsh as well and have oh_my_zsh installed. I haven't done a deep dive into the features yet but so far I like that I can customize the graphical interface with it. I also use starship for my prompt simply for the speed, auto-complete, and customization. Next I use tmux as well. Right now I mostly use it so I have multiple windows up at once but I am sure I will get into it for all the other reasons that people use it. (*screen shot to come*) <br><br>
Then lastly, NeoVim. I am officially a Nvim user. I am still getting used to all the motions and all the things with it but so far I really enjoy the fact that I can navigate everything without my hands leaving the keyboard. That is awesome! So I have a long way to go to become a master of nvim but I really like it so far. For my setup of Nvim, I am just using Lazy.vim because I am lazy and it has all the base features I would want. I also set up blink.cmp for an auto-complete which has been great! (more to come)
