### Who am I?

Hello dear reader! First I want to say, thank you for being interested enough to just click here. Hope you find my journey insightful. Let me introduce myself. My name is Mark Williams and I am not a computer scientist. I am actually a nurse that is interested in learning Comp Sci (I know some lingo). So here is my attempt at documenting my journey of learning computer science as an adult learner. 

### Where I started
So this is not my first time attempting to learn CS. When I first went to college in 2014 at the University of Oklahoma my degree was in CS. I took my intro to CS course where they taught *...drum roll...* Java! Nothing wrong with Java. Lots of great programs are currently maintained in Java (lets go Minecraft). However, as an 18 year old kid I did not find writing for loops that interesting. My biggest gripe was that we never made anything that interesting and they never showed the practical application why we were learning what we were learning/what you could do with programming. Soooooo I got bored, got a B in the class and changed majors. I had another brief time in programming when I was in art college. I wrote a Choose Your Adventure text game in C#. After that I did not program for many years.

However, that all changed in November of 2024! My wife and I were traveling to Poland with our at the time 5 month old son (yes, I know, we are a little crazy). We were sitting in the Helsinki Airport (great airport, 9/10 would recommend) and I had the thought, "I used to like to program, I should pick it back up". So I took out my phone and started looking in the app store for something to help me start learning. There I found Mimo. It was a Duolingo-like learning platform for programming. So I started learning Python in the middle of an airport using an app. *(more to come)*

## Where I am at now
As I learn, go through boot.dev, and anything else I do, this will be my log for it. Each day will have a little blurb about what I did that day and maybe how I felt about it. At the end of every month, I am going to do an end of the month recap where I go into more of my thought process of where I am at and what I want to do. That is my current plan, it might change but in the words of The Lopen:

## May 2025

### May 21st, 2025
I used the seer stone on lesson 3.1 on the Static Site Generator(ssg) for boot.dev. The reason why is I could not remember the code and what they were trying to have me do since it had been a couple days since worked on that project.
Also started the regex section of chapter 3 of the ssg.

### May 22nd, 2025
I worked on memory management in C at work. Blew a 13/15 sharpshooter spree because I didn't read the question fully, feels bad man.

### May 24th, 2025
Knocked out a bunch of memory management lessons at work since it was a slow day and my patients that day didn't need much (that is a rare occurrence). Redeemed myself and got my sharpshooter spree back!

### May 25th, 2025
Finishing up a Sabbath and then had some friends over so I didn't get much programming done. So I just got a lesson in ssg done before bed but I am happy that I am still making progress!

### May 26th, 2025
Started using Memo to start learning some frontend development in a casual way. Hoping that by the time I am ready to work on a frontend (I really like Svelte so I will probably use that) I at least of some idea of what I am attempting to do.

### May 29th, 2025
I haven't been able to sit down at my home computer in a couple days so all I have been able to work on is memory management while I am at work. I just have to remember that learning/doing a little is better than doing nothing!

### May 30th, 2025
I was finally able to sit down at my computer to work on ssg and I was able to finish all the inline markdown. Happy to finally make some progress on that project.

### May 31st, 2025
Had a slow day at work so I was able to work on memory management. It actually is starting to make a lot of sense to me and I found myself enjoying writing in C!

## May 2025 Wrap-up
