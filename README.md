Hello, dear reader! First, thank you for being curious enough to click here—I hope you find my journey insightful. <br><br>

My name is Mark Williams, and while I’m not a computer scientist, I *am* a nurse with a growing passion for computer science and this is my attempt at documenting my journey as an adult learner diving into CS. 

### Where I started
This isn’t my first attempt at learning CS. Back in 2014, I started college at the University of Oklahoma with a major in Computer Science. My first course introduced us to *drumroll…* Java! While Java is a solid and widely-used language (looking at you, Minecraft), it didn’t captivate me as an 18-year-old. We mostly wrote loops without seeing how they could build something meaningful. There was a lack of practical context, which made it hard to stay engaged. I ended up earning a B, lost interest, and switched majors.<br><br>
That changed in November 2024. <br><br>
While traveling to Poland with my wife and our five-month-old son (yes, I know, a bit wild), I found myself sitting in the Helsinki Airport (highly recommend—9/10). A random thought struck: “I used to enjoy programming. Why not pick it back up?” So I pulled out my phone and searched the app store. That’s when I discovered **Mimo**, a Duolingo-style app for learning programming. I started learning Python right there in the airport.<br><br>
From there, I entered the infamous “tutorial hell”—watching endless Python tutorials without truly learning how to program. Then I found **Harvard’s CS50**, which gave me a much better understanding of the fundamentals. Unfortunately, with my only free time during my son’s naps, progress was painfully slow. Eventually, I came across **boot.dev**, and something clicked. I started in February 2025 and have enjoyed every moment since. So, Lane—if you ever read this—thank you for creating such an amazing course!

## Where I am at now
This log will serve as my daily progress journal as I continue learning through boot.dev and other resources. Each day, I’ll write a short blurb about what I did and how I felt. At the end of every month, I’ll post a more detailed reflection.<br><br>

## May 2025

### May 21st, 2025
I used the seer stone on Lesson 3.1 (Static Site Generator) on boot.dev because I couldn’t remember the code or instructions—it had been a few days since I last worked on it. Also started the regex section of Chapter 3.

### May 22nd, 2025
Worked on memory management in C at work. Lost my 13/15 sharpshooter streak because I didn’t read a question carefully—feels bad man.

### May 24th, 2025
Productive day! Knocked out a bunch of memory management lessons at work since it was a slow day. My patients didn’t need much (a rare treat). Got my sharpshooter streak back—redemption!

### May 25th, 2025
It was Sabbath so I had some friends over and spent time with my family. Didn’t get much coding done, but I managed to finish a short lesson in SSG before bed. Still making progress!

### May 26th, 2025
Started using Mimo to casually explore front-end development. I’m really into Svelte, so I hope that by the time I dive into front-end work, I’ll at least have some foundation.

### May 29th, 2025
Haven’t been able to work from my home setup lately, so I’ve been studying memory management while at work. A little progress is better than none!

### May 30th, 2025
Finally sat down at my home computer and finished all the inline markdown work for the SSG project. Feels great to make real progress.

### May 31st, 2025
Another slow day at work allowed me to study more memory management. It’s finally starting to make sense, and I’m genuinely enjoying writing in C!

## May 2025 Wrap-up

### Learning The Ways of The Penguin

May was a major milestone in my CS journey—I officially switched to **Linux!** I’d been toying with the idea for a while, but what finally pushed me over the edge was watching PewDiePie’s video about switching to Linux, followed by The Primeagen’s reaction. That did it. I took the plunge. <br><br>
I chose **Linux Mint** as my distro because I wanted something that worked out of the box and looked familiar—my wife, who isn’t tech-savvy, would also be using it. Mint was a great choice. It felt less like diving into the deep end and more like wading into the pool—just challenging enough to keep me engaged without overwhelming me. <br><br>
Then came the setup of my dev environment—which, wow, is a rabbit hole. So many options! After some digging, here’s what I landed on:<br><br>
- Terminal: I’m using **Alacritty**. It’s blazing fast, has fantastic documentation, and a vibrant community. I’ve uploaded my alacritty.toml in my config_files folder on this repo. (screenshot coming soon)
- Shell: Switched from bash to **zsh** and installed *Oh My Zsh*. Haven’t explored all the features yet, but I love the customization.
- Prompt: Using **Starship** for its speed, autocomplete, and customizability.
- Multiplexer: I use **tmux** mainly to have multiple windows open at once, but I plan to explore more of its features soon. (screenshot coming soon)
- Editor: I’ve officially joined Team **Neovim**! Still learning the motions and shortcuts, but I love keeping my hands on the keyboard. I use LazyVim for setup—it’s easy and has all the essentials. I also configured blink.cmp for autocomplete, which has been fantastic.

### Boot.dev Progress
- Started working on the Static Site Generator project this month and wow it is kicking my butt! This is definitely the hardest project yet. I have recently learned that this is not a unique experience for this project! I have been using Boots or a seer stone on almost lesson and at first I was feeling really guilty for doing so. What I have to remember is that it is not a bad thing to use resources and tools that are given to you to figure it out. That is just part of the learning process...
