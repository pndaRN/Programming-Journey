# Programming Journey ðŸ“š
> "Journey before Pancakes" - The Lopen

Welcome to my coding adventure! This is where I document my journey from nurse to... well, we'll see where this goes.

## About This Journey

I'm Mark Williams, a nurse who caught the programming bug (again) while sitting in Helsinki Airport with my wife and five-month-old son. What started as a random "let me try coding again" moment has turned into a full-blown obsession with computer science, terminal applications, and apparently, way too many configuration files.

This repo contains my daily progress logs, monthly reflections, and the occasional existential crisis about whether I actually understand pointers in C.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Daily logs**: Short updates on what I learned, what broke, and how I felt about it
- **Reflections**: Longer reflections on progress, setbacks, and random tangents
- **Project documentation**: Details about my current builds and experiments
- **Configuration files**: Because I spent way too much time tweaking my setup not to share it

## Current Focus

- **Boot.dev coursework**: Working through their computer science fundamentals
- **SilentMemoir**: Building a terminal-based journaling app (because I apparently love terminals now)
- **Learning C**: Turns out I really enjoy languages that make me think about memory management

## The Journey So Far

Started in February 2025 after years away from programming. Went from "what's a pointer?" to "I unironically love writing C" in just a few months. Now documenting the journey through regular reflections rather than daily logs - turns out quality beats quantity when it comes to meaningful learning insights.
