### Who am I?

Hello, dear reader! First, thank you for being curious enough to click here—I hope you find my journey insightful. <br><br>

My name is Mark Williams, and while I’m not a computer scientist, I *am* a nurse with a growing passion for computer science and this is my attempt at documenting my journey as an adult learner diving into CS. 

### Where I started
This isn’t my first attempt at learning CS. Back in 2014, I started college at the University of Oklahoma with a major in Computer Science. My first course introduced us to *drumroll…* Java! While Java is a solid and widely-used language (looking at you, Minecraft), it didn’t captivate me as an 18-year-old. We mostly wrote loops without seeing how they could build something meaningful. There was a lack of practical context, which made it hard to stay engaged. I ended up earning a B, lost interest, and switched majors.<br><br>
That changed in November 2024. <br><br>
While traveling to Poland with my wife and our five-month-old son (yes, I know, a bit wild), I found myself sitting in the Helsinki Airport (highly recommend—9/10). A random thought struck: “I used to enjoy programming. Why not pick it back up?” So I pulled out my phone and searched the app store. That’s when I discovered **Mimo**, a Duolingo-style app for learning programming. I started learning Python right there in the airport.<br><br>
From there, I entered the infamous “tutorial hell”—watching endless Python tutorials without truly learning how to program. Then I found **Harvard’s CS50**, which gave me a much better understanding of the fundamentals. Unfortunately, with my only free time during my son’s naps, progress was painfully slow. Eventually, I came across **boot.dev**, and something clicked. I started in February 2025 and have enjoyed every moment since. So, Lane—if you ever read this—thank you for creating such an amazing course!

## Where I am at now
This log will serve as my daily progress journal as I continue learning through boot.dev and other resources. Each day, I’ll write a short blurb about what I did and how I felt. At the end of every month, I’ll post a more detailed reflection.<br><br>
