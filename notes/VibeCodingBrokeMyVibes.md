# Vibe Coding Has My Vibe Broken

Alright, I'm trying something new here. Instead of those tiny daily updates that basically amounted to "I did a thing, it was fine" (which honestly felt like those discussion board replies we all had to suffer through in college), I'm switching to medium-sized blog posts. Wait, do I have a blog now? That's... actually kind of cool!

The idea is to still capture what I'm working on but with actual detail and meaning instead of the programming equivalent of "dear diary, today was Tuesday."

Speaking of learning curves - Jekyll is absolutely giving me a run for my money. Here's the thing: I know basically zero frontend stuff. Like, I know what HTML and CSS *are*, I know some frameworks exist (React, Svelte, Ruby), and I know I don't like divs. That's... pretty much it.

So naturally, I dove headfirst into Jekyll themes. I figured out there are different themes and that I could use "just-the-docs" as a remote theme because I liked how clean it looked. Everything was going great until I decided to add some custom CSS.
