# October 2025 Wrap Up

This month has flown by! I finished my September wrap-up, then the next thing I know it's the end of October and time to write another one. Let me try my best to remember everything I did this month, lol.

## Boot.dev Progress

I have ascended to Arch Sage in Boot.dev now! It's crazy to think about all the work I've put into this program since I started on February 20th when I submitted my first lesson. I've gone from "how am I ever going to build something on my own?" to now having people I know reach out asking if I can build them something—and actually knowing somewhat how to do it. That's wild to me. I've made this much progress in such a short amount of time.

### JavaScript

I finished the JS course at the beginning of this month, and I'm glad I took a break from the primary coursework to do it because it's given me the confidence to try and figure out some frontend stuff. I know, I know—I'm a traitor for leaving backend—but with the things I want to build and do, I need full stack knowledge. Finishing JS at least gave me a foundation to get started. 

From there, I'm slowly building a website for my wife and me because we're starting the process of private adoption, and having a website documenting our story and progress will be really nice to have.

### Go

I've officially started the second half of the Boot.dev coursework—woop woop!! Go is interesting so far, and it took a while to get used to the syntax. Like, when do I put a semicolon? When do I put a curly bracket? It's an interesting mixture of C and Python.

I'm excited to get into the actual backend work with Go and understand why I've heard such good things about it. Which is very timely because...

## I Am Developing an App!

The other day I was at work (I'm an ICU nurse, as a reminder), and I went down to the cafeteria and started talking to the APRN I work with in the ICU. After some casual conversation, he looked at me and said, "You code, right?" I said I'm taking a course to learn how to code and have an okay understanding of it. 

Well, long story short—he wants to make a medication tracking app that gamifies taking medication and provides good education that people will actually understand for their meds and conditions. So I said I would do it! We're building an app together now. I'm using Flutter as the frontend so I only have to write one set of code for iOS, Android, and Web, and I'll be using Go as the backend once we get past our MVP stage! The Go course has come at the perfect time because eventually I'll be building an entire backend in Go!

### Learning Dart

Flutter is written in a language called Dart that was released by Google with the vision of being "JavaScript done right." After writing in it and vibe coding (great for UI prototyping) for a little bit, it's essentially another OOP language with C-lite syntax. Even in the vibes, I've been able to read it, understand what's going on, and change it based on my needs. 

It's my current fixation because I love building things and I'm seeing everything I'm building right before me. It feels amazing that after almost a year of learning how to program, I'm at this point where I can sit down in a language I don't know and be able to build something relatively quickly! It's so encouraging. I'm still working on the Go coursework at work when things are slow and I have limited time.

## Gaming

I said last month I was going to include what I'm playing, so here we go! I'm currently playing Lies of P and it's so fun—another great rec by ChatGPT! I've put in about 10-ish hours and I know I'm probably not even halfway done. I really like how smooth the combat is and how aggressive you can be while it still punishes you for being too aggressive. It's great having a game to pick up when I just want to unplug my brain!
