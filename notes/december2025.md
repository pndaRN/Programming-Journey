# November/December 2025 Wrap Up
Where did this last two months go??? The holidays really makes time get away from you. By the time I realized I had not written any thing for November it was almost half way through December! Time flys when you don't know what day it is half of the time. Anyways that enough talk about time, its *time* to talk about coding.

In November, I really didn't feel like I made much progress in the Go courses but after looking back at the last wrap up I was only starting the courses and here I am with the first two done and I am now starting on SQL/Pokedex. When I get to a guided project I still like to have at one course that I am going through because that allows me time to learn while I am at work because I can only work on the guided projects at home. So far the Pokedex project is pretty easy in my option but I am sure it will ramp up as I get into section 2 and 3 of it. 
SQL is really interesting! So far I like working with it because it just makes sense to me lol. I am ~40/~120 lessons in so I sure that it will ramp up as I get deeper into it. Maybe the combo of working in Go and in SQL is where it gets spicy. However, learning SQL has gotten me excited to finish the Go courses/backend work because I am ready to start building the backend to the app I am making
