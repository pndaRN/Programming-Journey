## June 2025
### June 1st, 2025
Okay I legit love C! Is that weird?? It just makes sense to my grug brain for some reason and I really enjoy it! I might dive into it a bit more as a side project!

### June 4th, 2025
The Static Site Generator project is tough for me! It's probably because I haven't been devoting all my programming time to it, so I keep getting confused with other stuff. Still making progress though - just one more chapter to go!

### June 9th, 2025
I was able to knock out an entire chapter on memory management at work today! Also feeling very validated about SSG with the announcement by Boot.dev!<br> <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5300111d-c08e-4105-aa9d-4c7dcb8f77eb" alt="announcement" height="853" width="480">

### June 10th, 2025
My SSG code is completely broken right now, haha. I have no idea where things went sideways, and I have had to use so many seer stones to get this last chapter working! My plan is to just push through and finish the project however I can, then come back and clean it up properly once I'm done with the main coursework at boot.dev.

### June 16th, 2025
Only 2 more lessons on memory management! I've really enjoyed this course and definitely want to dive deeper into C once I finish boot.dev!

### June 19th, 2025
I finished memory management!!! I really loved this course so much and I'm so thankful they included it. I feel like I have a better understanding of how memory works and why memory management is so important. I also liked writing in a language with more syntax and structure - it just made reading code easier for me. Definitely want to do more C later once I finish the main boot.dev coursework!

### June 20th, 2025
Finished SSG! Definitely needed a lot of help on the last chapter because I messed up my code early on! I definitely want to go back and redo this project because I felt way over my head and ended up using a lot of AI assistance beyond just Boots.

### June 23rd, 2025
Started the AI Agent guided project at Boot.dev! I'm excited to learn how to implement AI because I'm starting to have ideas for different things to build, and one of them involves AI implementation.

### June 25th, 2025 
Started the data structures course for those random pockets of time when I can squeeze in some coding or when work's moving at a snail's pace. Switching from C to Python is seriously messing with my brain - I literally just tried to write 'if list == NULL' and had to laugh at myself when I remembered that's not how Python works!

## June 2025 Wrap-up
### The Great Project Paradox: Completely Clueless Here, Totally Crushing It There
This perfectly captures how this month felt as I was living through it. SSG had me completely stumped - I needed help with practically everything just to stumble through it. Meanwhile, memory management in C was turning out to be some of the most fun I've had coding since I started Boot.dev! Honestly, that contrast has left me with this weird feeling about what I actually accomplished this month. Part of me feels like I barely programmed at all, but then I remember I actually finished both SSG and C this month. I think it's because most of my coding happened during hospital shifts rather than sitting comfortably at my desktop setup. <br><br>
What really came out of this though is that I definitely want to dive deeper into C/C++, or maybe explore something newer like Rust. I genuinely loved that style of programming - it just clicks with me somehow, and I found myself actually enjoying the problem-solving process instead of fighting it.

### Getting Interested in Software Business (Because Ramen Can't Fund My Projects Forever)
I've also gotten really curious about the business side of programming and software this month. After reading "No Rules Rules" last month, I found myself genuinely fascinated by how the business side of software actually works. That led me to discover Rob Walling, and I decided to dive into his first book "Start Small, Stay Small." <br> <br>
Here's the thing - I absolutely love programming, but I'm not sure I'd ever want to be a developer at a company. As a nurse working three twelve-hour shifts a week, I've got this amazing schedule that I'm honestly not ready to give up. The thought of going back to four or five days a week just doesn't appeal to me right now. So I'm exploring different ways to make money with programming that don't involve being a full-time dev. <br> <br>
Should be interesting to see where this curiosity takes me!

### My Plans for July
"I'm hoping to knock out the data structures course, finish building the AI Agent, and actually start my personal project this month. I'm thinking about building a recipe manager that can take screenshots or photos of recipes and recognize the text to build your own digital recipe book. It'll also let you create your own recipes from scratch.<br> <br>
For now, I'm leaning toward making it a CLI application so I don't have to wrestle with GUI stuff, but who knows - I might change my mind once I actually dive into it!
