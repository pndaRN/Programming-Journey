## May 2025
### May 21st, 2025
I used the seer stone on Lesson 3.1 (Static Site Generator) on boot.dev because I couldn’t remember the code or instructions—it had been a few days since I last worked on it. Also started the regex section of Chapter 3.

### May 22nd, 2025
Worked on memory management in C at work. Lost my 13/15 sharpshooter streak because I didn’t read a question carefully—feels bad man.

### May 24th, 2025
Productive day! Knocked out a bunch of memory management lessons at work since it was a slow day. My patients didn’t need much (a rare treat). Got my sharpshooter streak back—redemption!

### May 25th, 2025
It was Sabbath so I had some friends over and spent time with my family. Didn’t get much coding done, but I managed to finish a short lesson in SSG before bed. Still making progress!

### May 26th, 2025
Started using Mimo to casually explore front-end development. I’m really into Svelte, so I hope that by the time I dive into front-end work, I’ll at least have some foundation.

### May 29th, 2025
Haven’t been able to work from my home setup lately, so I’ve been studying memory management while at work. A little progress is better than none!

### May 30th, 2025
Finally sat down at my home computer and finished all the inline markdown work for the SSG project. Feels great to make real progress.

### May 31st, 2025
Another slow day at work allowed me to study more memory management. It’s finally starting to make sense, and I’m genuinely enjoying writing in C!

## May 2025 Wrap-up

### Learning The Ways of The Penguin

May was a major milestone in my CS journey—I officially switched to **Linux!** I’d been toying with the idea for a while, but what finally pushed me over the edge was watching PewDiePie’s video about switching to Linux, followed by The Primeagen’s reaction. That did it. I took the plunge. <br><br>
I chose **Linux Mint** as my distro because I wanted something that worked out of the box and looked familiar—my wife, who isn’t tech-savvy, would also be using it. Mint was a great choice. It felt less like diving into the deep end and more like wading into the pool—just challenging enough to keep me engaged without overwhelming me. <br><br>
Then came the setup of my dev environment—which, wow, is a rabbit hole. So many options! After some digging, here’s what I landed on:<br><br>
- Terminal: I’m using **Alacritty**. It’s blazing fast, has fantastic documentation, and a vibrant community. I’ve uploaded my alacritty.toml in my config_files folder on this repo. ![Alacritty Screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47508c35-2b08-4849-8cc4-2b1cac06cb3c)
- Shell: Switched from bash to **zsh** and installed *Oh My Zsh*. Haven’t explored all the features yet, but I love the customization.

- Prompt: Using **Starship** for its speed, autocomplete, and customizability.
- Multiplexer: I use **tmux** mainly to have multiple windows open at once, but I plan to explore more of its features soon. (screenshot coming soon)
- Editor: I’ve officially joined Team **Neovim**! Still learning the motions and shortcuts, but I love keeping my hands on the keyboard. I use LazyVim for setup—it’s easy and has all the essentials. I also configured blink.cmp for autocomplete, which has been fantastic.![Nvim screenshot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/baf68555-5baf-44f4-b618-6b4c199dc1b3)


### Boot.dev Progress
I started working on the Static Site Generator project this month and wow, it is kicking my butt! This is definitely the hardest project yet. I recently learned that this isn't a unique experience for this project! I've been using Boots or a seer stone on almost every lesson, and at first I was feeling really guilty about it. What I have to remember is that it's not a bad thing to use the resources and tools that are given to you to figure things out. That's just part of the learning process. It will feel so good when I get it done! <br><br>
I also started the memory management in C course for when I don't want to work on SSG but still want to program/while I'm at work. I really like it! Like, I love the flow of writing in C, so I'll definitely want to do my own project in it. I was also told that if I like C, I should check out Rust, so maybe one day I'll get to that! But right now I'll just keep chugging along with memory management and enjoying every step!

### Current Thoughts and Ideas
I know I'm approaching my first personal project, so I've already started thinking about different ideas for what I want to build. What I've landed on is a recipe book/meal planner/grocery list app called **What's Cookin**. I want to build it in a way that will help my wife and me with our weekly meal planning and grocery shopping, because right now we just use a Google doc since we don't like any of the other apps out there for that task. So hopefully I can build something useful for us to use.<br><br> 
With that in mind, I've thought of different ways I could possibly launch it to others, so I've been looking at different frontend systems. In my limited time and searching, I found **Svelte** and I really like the concept of it and how it works. To help me learn HTML and CSS, I'm using **Mimo** again. Not super strict, but just using it as I think about it since my focus right now is Boot.dev. I've also started the tutorial on Svelte's website to start getting familiar with it. <br><br>
That's what I've learned and what I'm moving towards! See you in June!
